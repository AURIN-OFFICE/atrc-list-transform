A very simple JS script that can get the head or tail from an array. 

Running the script `list_head_test_script.sh` should successfully build and run the containerised script, passing input files from the `test_inputs` directory and setting `MODE` as an environment variable in the call to `docker run`. The result should be written to `data/outputs`.
